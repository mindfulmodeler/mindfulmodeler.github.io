* **Bayesian inference**: the reallocation of credibility across possibiliites
  - *possibilities* are parameter values in meaningful mathematical models
  - the credibilities of all the possibilities will add up to 1
  - the re-allocated distribution of credibility is the **posterior distribution**. It is what we now believe after taking in new evidence. It then becomes the prior beliefs if we are going to keep making new obeservations. 

* “How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever
remains, however improbable, must be the truth?” (Doyle, 1890, chap. 6)

As you gain more information through your observations of the system, you begin to learn that certain explanations are more credible than others. It's a very natural way to learn

* The shape of the Normal Distribution is described by two parameters:
  1. The **location parameter** (mean) describes the central tendency of the distribution
  2. The **scale parameter** (standard deviation) describes the width/dispersion of the distribution
  - Bayesian is all about adjusting parameters like these until you find a curve that fits the data well.
  - But just because you've found a good mathematical fit does not mean that you have a **causal explanation**. We still don't know what happened that led to the data having that form in the real world. 

Steps of Bayesian Analysis:
1. What variable(s) are you trying to predict? (and what are your predictors) 
2. Define a model that appropriately describes the data
3. Specify a prior distribution on the params
