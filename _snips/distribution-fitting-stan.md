With the pystan package, you can either import a .stan file or you can define your stan model directly in the script. The three mandatory parts of the stan model definition are: (1) data; (2) parameters; and (3) model. 

{% highlight ruby %}
stan_model = """
data {
    int<lower=1> N; //Number of observed data
    real Y[N]; //observed data
    int<lower=1> K; //Number of mixture components;
    }
    
parameters
    simplex[K] theta; //mixing proportions for K components
    ordered[K} mu;
    vector<lower=0>[K] sigma; // prior on SD, cant be neg
    }
    
model {
    vector[K] log_theta = log(theta);
    real N2=N;
    //set priors
    mu[1]~normal(-3.4, 4)
    mu[2]~normal(-0.1, 2)
    
    //same prior for each simplex
    sigma~gamma(4,2)
    
    for (n in 1:N){
    vector[K] lps=log_theta;
        for (k in 1:K)
            lps[k] = lps[k] + normal_lpdf(Y[n] | mu[k], sigma[k]);
        target += log_sum_exp(lps);
        }
    }
"""
{% endhighlight %}

One thing to keep in mind is that the variables defined within the *model* block of code are local. That is, the *data* and *parameter* blocks don't know about them. 

After defining the model, the next step is to compile the model. Compiling will take a few minutes - although it is also possible to pickle the model in order to avoid repeat compiling.  

{% highlight ruby %}
sm = pystan.StanModel(model_code=stan_model)
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, we can specify our parameters, including the number of iterations to cycle though. Usually, at least three independent chains are run. 

{% highlight ruby %}
#set up parameters
NumK = 2
ITER = 2000
NUMCHAIN = 4
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
#define data and run model
Dat = {'N':len(dataframe), 'Y':dataframe, 'K':NumK}
fit = sm.sampling(data=Dat, n_jobs=1, iter=ITER, chains=NUMCHAIN)
{% endhighlight %}


## Interpreting the results
For anyone new to Stan or Bayesian statistics, understanding how well the model fit the data is not a trivial task. There are some indicators that are automatically calculated by Stan in the summary statistics, which can be viewed with `print(fit)`. 
1. The R-hat statistic (**R^hat**)
    - GOOD: when Rhat is <1.1 (if not, consider longer runs)
2. The effective sample size (**n_eff**)
    - GOOD: larger n_eff values, (at least 100 usually)

If the fit appears to be poor because of these indicators, it is a sign that different priors should be chosen or that a greater number of samples is needed.
